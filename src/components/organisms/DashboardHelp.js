          We made this app for intermediate and upper-intermediate learners of
          English who want to become advanced speakers.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          To be able to communicate in any language, we must first understand
          its basic building blocks: individual words. This is what this app
          helps you achieve. When teaching vocabulary, most teaching methods
          (and apps) focus far too much on repetition and far too little on
          understanding and practice.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Language learning should be practical first and foremost.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Instead of just definitions, we've made example sentences with how
          words are actually used by native speakers. This method will help you
          build confidence and understanding.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          We also encourage you to write down as many example sentences of your
          own as you like. The more you practice using a word, the better you
          will be able to actually use it.
          <br></br>

          To begin learning words, click on one of our modules. You can practice
          the modules in any order you like; we'll always store your progress.
