let abandon = {
  name: `Abandon`,
  definitionShort: `to leave somebody, especially somebody you are responsible for,
  with no intention of returning`,
  definitionExpanded: `The verb abandon means to leave somebody, especially somebody you are responsible for,
  with no intention of ever returning. It can also relate to a place or thing, and in this
  sense it is often impossible or dangerous to stay. A captain could give the order to
  abandon his ship because it is sinking, for example. Another meaning of abandon is that you
  simply stop doing something, often before it is finished. The word originated from the
  Old French abandoner, which meant "to bring under control". Later on, this gave rise to "to give in to the 
  control of" and "to surrender to". Abandon can also be used as a noun, but this usage is far more rare.`,
  exampleOne: `The race was abandoned because of the relentless downpour.`,
  exampleTwo: `They abandoned the crashed vehicle because it was about to explode.`,
  exampleThree: `The bird found a foster home after it was abandoned by its previous owners.`,
  exampleFour: `Even in desperate situations, parents should not abandon their children without good cause.`,

let absolute = {
  name: `Absolute`,
  definitionShort: `total and complete`,
  definitionExpanded: `The adjective absolute means total and complete. If a physics course were for absolute 
  beginners, almost everybody could safely sign up, including your 85-year-old, set-in-her-ways neighbor 
  with zero experience. And if a court decision is absolute, you had better brace yourself because it cannot be 
  turned back. The word absolute leaves little room for doubt, no matter in what way it is used. Absolute proof
  is watertight and absolute rules are like the laws of nature. The word absolute originated from Latin absolutus,
  which means "freed or unrestricted". More rarely, absolute can be used as a noun in which case it refers to 
  some belief or principle that is always considered to be true. `,
  exampleOne: `The old kings had absolute power and were not afraid to use it.`,
  exampleTwo: `Their dominance over their opponents was absolute.`,
  exampleThree: `I know like to know the absolute truth, but I know that this goal is unrealistic.`,
  exampleFour: `We'd like to keep customer complaints to an absolute minimum.`,

let academic = {
  name: `Academic`,
  definitionShort: `connected with education, especially studying in 
  schools and universities`,
  definitionExpanded: `The adjective academic is connected with education, especially higher education. An academic 
  career refers to a person's accomplishments within the realm of higher education, in which he or she was probably 
  conducting research. And if you are studying at an prestigious academic institution, your job prospects should 
  be pretty good. The word academic conjures up images of thick books, tough tests, and hard-working students whose
  eyesight might not be as good as it used to be. Finally, if a subject is academic, it is probably not very practical,
  and perhaps not even worth considering. The word academic has a long history, but it originated from the Greek Akadēmos,
  who was a hero after whom Plato named his garden. From there, the word meandered its way through Medieval Latin 
  and French, until it finally arrived in English.`,
  exampleOne: `Her career had been mostly academic until she signed up with the e-commerce vendor`,
  exampleTwo: `If only my son had been more academic; he could have been a grand success.`,
  exampleThree: `The subject was so academic that it had almost zero practical value.`,

let acceptable = {
  name: `Acceptable`,
  definitionShort: `agreed or approved of by most people in a society`,
  definitionExpanded: `The adjective acceptable means that something is agreed upon or approved by most people
  in a society or group. Declining an invitation to your best friend's wedding party might not be very acceptable, 
  for example, so doing so is at your own risk. If something is or becomes universally acceptable, people everywhere 
  consider it to be okay. (Although it is doubtful that this would ever be the case for declining the 
  wedding-invitations of loved ones). Acceptable can also signify that something is good enough. Business-casual
  dress might be perfectly acceptable for a high-level sales meeting, for example--and for a best friend's wedding 
  party too. However, a -C might not be very acceptable if you want to pass your math class, so you should probably 
  study a little harder. You should also watch calling your girlfriend's cooking acceptable. Yes, this means you 
  think her meals are good enough. Just not that good. The word acceptable originates from Latin acceptabilis, 
  which meant "to take something for oneself." From there, it entered Middle English.`,
  exampleOne: `The car seemed to be in acceptable condition but broke down after just two weeks.`,
  exampleTwo: `Socially acceptable behavaior is something that all children must learn.`,
  exampleThree: `Both parties strived to find an acceptable solution.`,

let accompany = {
  name: `Accompany`,
  definitionShort: `to travel or go somewhere with somebody/something`,
  definitionExpanded: `The verb accompany means to travel or go somewhere with somebody/something, and it is 
  a rather formal definition. You would probably not say that your children accompanied you on a picnic. 
  However, you could say that an adult should accompany every child on a mountain hike. Accompany also has
  another commonly used definition: something happening or appearing together with something else. Excited
  shouts could accompany the scurrying feet of a group of children. And if stunning photographs accompany
  the content of a website, it is probably a pleasant read. The word accompany entered Middle English via 
  Old French, where it meant "companion."`,
  exampleOne: `I wish my daughter could accompany me.`,
  exampleTwo: `His entrance was accompanied by particularly loud music.`,
  exampleThree: `You won't make it far into the jungle without a local guide.`,

let account = {
  name: `Account`,
  definitionShort: `an arrangement that somebody has with a bank, etc.
  to keep money there, take some out, etc.`,
  definitionExpanded: `The noun account is an arrangement that somebody has with a bank. Your account 
  allows you to safely store your money and take it out whenever you need it (at least, that is how the 
  system was supposed to work). However, in the digital age, account has taken on an entirely new meaning.
  Your email account enables you to send messages across the internet while your YouTube account allows you
  to endlessly watch funny cat videos. Also, if you run a business, your accounts store your financial data. 
  However, in this sense, we usually use the plural form accounts. Finally, an account is a detailed description
  of something that has happened, such as a seizure because of endlessly watching funny cat videos. We can
  call such reports eyewitness accounts or first-hand accounts. The word account originates from Old French acont,
  a word that relates to counting.`,
  exampleOne: `I would like to open up a bank account here.`,
  exampleTwo: `She gave a vivid and fascinating account of the events.`,
  exampleThree: `By all accounts, the team tried their hardest to succeed.`,

let accurate = {
  name: `Accurate`,
  definitionShort: `correct and true in every detail`,
  definitionExpanded: `The modifier accurate means that something is correct and valid in every detail. For 
  example, if a depiction is accurate, you can rely on it because accurate leaves no room for error. And if 
  you're in business, you want your costs to be accurate so that you can predict future revenue. A highly 
  accurate compass should always point North while an accurate watch should prevent you from ever running late.
   The word accurate originated from Latin accuratus, which simply means "done with care."`,
  exampleOne: `For scientific research, accurate measurements are paramount.`,
  exampleTwo: `A single but remarkably detailed account was all that we had left.`,
  exampleThree: `My watch isn't as accurate anymore as it used to be.`,
  exampleFour: `If your shot was accurate, the deer should be dead by now.`,

let accuse = {
  name: `Accuse`,
  definitionShort: `to say that somebody has done something wrong 
  or is guilty of something`,
  definitionExpanded: `We use the verb accuse to say that somebody has done something wrong or is 
  guilty of something. You might accuse your neighbor of playing his music too loudly or your
  grandmother of secretly murdering your cat. However, in the latter case, you might want to tread 
  lightly because people do not like to be accused without basis. However, an accusation does not have
  to be true. It could be wholly fabricated, and it would still be a proper example of the verb. Yes,
  that goes for those allegations against your sweet-old grandmother as well. Accuse entered our 
  language through Latin via Old French. In those times, the verb accusare meant "call to account."`,
  exampleOne: `He accused his grandmother of cooking innocent bunnies alive.`,
  exampleTwo: `Her accusation turned out to be wholly fabricated.`,
  exampleThree: `It's all too easy to accuse the government of incompetence, isn't it?`,

let acknowledge = {
  name: `Acknowledge`,
  definitionShort: `to accept that something is true`,
  definitionExpanded: `To acknowledge means to accept that something is true. An elderly gentleman who
  is set in his way might not acknowledge any need for reform, for example. Nor might the 30-year president 
  of a dictatorship. If you're the manager of an international firm, you would probably want your subordinates
  to acknowledge your status. In this sense, acknowledge has more to do with one's authority than the fact of being 
  true. However, that is as much a legitimate use of the verb, and quite common as well. Acknowledge stems from a
  Middle English verb that has long since fallen out of use.`,
  exampleOne: `She refused to acknowledge any responsibility.`,
  exampleTwo: `He acknowledged having been there but not at the supposed time.`,
  exampleThree: `It's becoming harder and harder to be acknowledged as an expert in this field.`,

let acquire = {
  name: `Acquire`,
  definitionShort: `acquire something to gain something by your own efforts, 
  ability or behaviour`,
  definitionExpanded: `To acquire something means to gain by your own efforts. For example, if you've acquired 
  a fortune through legitimate trade, you should be pretty proud of yourself. Likewise, though perhaps not 
  quite as sexy, intellectual wisdom is unquestionably something that one can acquire. However, fortune can also
  be acquired through inheritance, and in this case, there is little effort involved. Acquire stems from Latin 
  acquirere, which means getting something in addition to something else.`,
  exampleOne: `He acquired more wealth than any other hobbit had before him.`,
  exampleTwo: `He had acquired not one but two paintings by Da Vinci.`,
  exampleThree: `A reputation for dishonestly can be hard to shake off.`,

let actual = {
  name: `Actual`,
  definitionShort: `used to emphasize something that is real or exists in fact`,
  definitionExpanded: `We use the modifier actual to emphasize that something is real or that it exists. For example,
  you might want to base your next financial decision on actual data instead of fabrications. And if 
  you're going to quote a local politician for your newspaper story, you should probably write down his actual words. 
  Actual has a second meaning, and that is to emphasize the most indispensable part of something. A car would be 
  of little use without an actual engine. And without an autograph underneath, most contracts would be pretty useless. 
  Actual stems from Latin actualis, which means an event or something that somebody does.`,
  exampleOne: `The actual performance was dismal and caused many audience members to leave.`,
  exampleTwo: `The actual burden was not as heavy as he had feared.`,
  exampleThree: `Does the sasquatch exist in actual fact?`,

let adapt = {
  name: `Adapt`,
  definitionShort: `to change your behaviour in order to deal more successfully

  (In fact, a  few particularly stubborn [ex] co-workers came to mind while I wrote this, and they might
    for you as well). Anyway, adapting 
  is a fundamental part of life, especially in a society that evolves as rapidly as ours. For example,
  classrooms can be adapted to wheelchairs, while your language can be adapted to communicate better. 
  An entirely different meaning of adapt is turning a book into a movie or play. (Or, if you're 
  a geek like me, a Japanese manga into an anime.) Adapt stems from Latin adaptare. `,
  exampleOne: `The entrances to the tracks have been adapted take wheelchairs.`,
  exampleTwo: `Some people are simply more adaptable than others by nature.`,
