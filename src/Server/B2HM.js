  things you could handle. You could do so carelessly, roughly, skillfully, or competently, 
  etc. The types of things that a person could handle are almost endless, and I'm sure you 
  could think of many other examples. Vehicles like cars, trucks, or buses can be handled
  too, as can tools or other implements. Handle originates from the Old English noun 
  handle.`,

  You wouldn't want to inflict serious harm on a friend, for example, but 
  you might want to shield your sister from harm. If a person has enemies, he
  or she might wish harm upon them. But I wouldn't want to suffer any harm myself 
  if I had a choice. Your sweet old grandmother is so kind that she wouldn't 
  harm a fly--an idiom that is quite common in English. Harm is a word of 
  Germanic origin, and we can use it as both a verb and a noun.`,

  though your teenage son might choose to ingest it anyway. And sugar could 
  seriously damage your teeth if you have too much of it. A person might consider 
  something harmful even if its effects aren't wholly proven—for example, 
  prescription drugs.`,

  lives. If you're Christian, you might believe that you're going to heaven after 
  you die. But if you're an atheist like me, you might think the concept to be 
  ludicrous. If you're a shopping addict, the mall in the city center might be 
  heaven for you--or even heaven on earth. But spending time with your obnoxious 
  sister-in-law might not be. Something can be heaven for a particular group of 
  people, such as a mountain trail for hikers. Or a sorbet for ice-cream lovers. 
  The word heaven is of Germanic origin.`,

  or rock on their heels to keep their distance from a snake. Ballerina's often 
  pivot or spin on their heels while soldiers may click them to salute. The word 
  heel may refer to shoewear too, namely the part below the ankle. Many types of

  uncertain or nervous. You can hesitate for a moment before replying or appear to 
  hesitate because you keep silent. It's possible to make someone hesitate as well, 
  for example, by reprimanding them. Hesitate can also mean that you are worried about 
  doing something, for example, speaking your mind. The Dutch do not often suffer 
  from this condition, but a Japanese woman in her 50's might. The word hesitate

  definitionShort: `measuring a long distance from the bottom to the top`,
  definitionExpanded: `High is an adjective with many different meanings. You 
  may think it to be one of the most basic words in English, but this makes 
  high quite complex. High can relate to the distance between the bottom 
  and the top of something, but it can also mean that some quantity or size 
  is above average. An all-time high is the highest that something has ever 
  been, such as the maximum temperature in a particular country. Your career 
  can reach a high point too, for example, when you become a famous author. 
  And when your rank in the navy is high, you can be sure to have a privileged

  hiring or not hiring, and if you're with HR, you could be the one responsible for 
  hiring. Hiring is possible for a short time as well; for example, a designer to

  you borrow it for a short time. Or perhaps your company can't afford to hire
  because of budgetary issues. In that case, you might want to chat with the

  definitionShort: `having a hole or empty space inside`,
  definitionExpanded: `The word hollow describes that something has a hole 
  or empty space inside. A tree could be hollow, but one's cheeks could 
  be too. In the latter sense, hollow means that the specified body part 
  sinks deeply into the face. A hollow feeling is a negative emotion that 
  makes you feel empty inside, while a hollow promise is a promise that means 
  very little at all. It is simply not sincere. Hollow can be used as a noun 
  too, and in this sense, it means that a surface is lower than the 
  surrounding space. Or, like the adjective, that something has an empty
  space inside. Hollow stems from Old English and is related to hole. `,

let holy = {

  in this sense, means good in both a moral and a religious way. Not only saints
  can be holy, but temples, shrines, and other spaces can be too. The Bible is

let honour = {
  name: `Honour`,

  definitionExpanded: `If you're the guest of honor, you are the most important person
  at the party. The word honor means having great respect for somebody, such as 
  for the top scorer of your national soccer league. But honor can be used as a 
  verb too. You could say somebody honors you with their presence, but be careful
  because they could take it as sarcasm. The honor of doing something can be dubious,
  which means it isn't an honor at all. Would you honestly like the honor of cleaning 
  your company's restrooms? I thought not. But a honor can be great, rare, special,
  or even rare. The word honor stems from Latin honos/honor, and entered Middle English 
  via Old French.`,

  can be much appreciated. Host can also be used as a verb with much the same meaning. 
  However, the verb may also refer to the fact that somebody introduces a television

  provide private housing, not governments. Housing can be either permanent or temporary,

  that makes it funny or the ability of someone to laugh at funny things. Humor comes 
  in many different forms: ironic, tongue-in-cheek, self-deprecating, or deadpan. The latter
  is particularly interesting because it means that someone tells a humorous story while 
  pretending to be completely serious. Meanwhile, irreverent humor shows a lack of respect
