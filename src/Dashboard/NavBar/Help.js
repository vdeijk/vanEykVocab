            We made this app for intermediate and upper-intermediate learners of
            English who want to become advanced speakers.
          </p>

          <p>
            To be able to communicate in any language, we must first understand
            its basic building blocks: individual words. This is what this app
            helps you achieve. When teaching vocabulary, most teaching methods
            (and apps) focus far too much on repetition and far too little on
            understanding and practice.
          </p>

          <p>Language learning should be practical first and foremost.</p>
          <p>
            Instead of just definitions, we've made example sentences with how
            words are actually used by native speakers. This method will help
            you build confidence and understanding.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also encourage you to write down as many example sentences of
            your own as you like. The more you practice using a word, the better
            you will be able to actually use it.
          </p>

            To begin learning words, click on one of our modules. You can
            practice the modules in any order you like; we'll always store your
            progress.
